This is a minimal demo of using jpackage.

To configure it, create a file gradle.properties with two entries:

----
org.gradle.java.home=/path/to/jdk-11
jpackage.home=/path/to/jdk-13-with-jpackage
----

The idea is to build everything with JDK 11, and then use the early access jpackage just for packaging.

Then build:

----
./gradlew build
----

Then run:

----
build/app-image/demo/demo
----
